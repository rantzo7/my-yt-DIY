## How it works

You start the application.

Add your favourite channels in the settings page.

The app will fetch the latest videos from your subscribed channels and display them in chronological order.

Your subscriptions will be scraped from youtube every 30 minutes. No API key needed.

Then you can download a video to watch it locally. If you host `my-yt` on your local network you can watch videos on all your devices.

You can ignore videos that you don't want to watch.

You can search for videos based on your subscriptions.

If you want, the app can also generate a summary of the video content using your local AI model or hosted provider.

Additionally, in the settings page you can set the video quality of the downloaded videos, clean up disk space used, avoid seeing clickbait thumbnails and much more.


## Installation (node.js)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/christian-fei/my-yt.git
cd my-yt
npm i
# install yt-dlp, https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp
# install ffmpeg, https://ffmpeg.org/
# optionally, create an .env file (you can copy .env.example as a template)

npm start
```


> Application runs on http://localhost:3000




## Installation (docker)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/christian-fei/my-yt.git
cd my-yt
docker compose up --build -d
```

or

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 -v /path/to/your/data/folder/for/persistence:/app/data christianfei/my-yt:latest
# ok calm down, here is an actual example command to copy-n-paste, jeez
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 -v $HOME/my-yt-data:/app/data christianfei/my-yt:latest
```




## Environment variables for LLM integration

| Variable  |  Type |  Default |
|---|---|---|
| AI_APIKEY | string  |   |
| AI_MODEL |  string |  meta-llama-3.1-8b-instruct |
| AI_HOST | string  |  http://127.0.0.1:1234 |
| AI_ENDPOINT | string  |  /v1/chat/completions |
| AI_TEMPERATURE | string  |  0 |


**Simply set the env variables to your needs, by following the format above (e.g. url starting with "http", no ending slash, AI_ENDPOINT with leading slash and path)**

Some examples:

```bash
AI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini AI_HOST=https://api.openai.com AI_APIKEY=sk-proj-123 npm start

# you can also set them in the `.env` file (you can copy .env.example as a template)

# or with docker in background, using OpenAI
docker run -e AI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini -e AI_HOST=https://api.openai.com -e AI_APIKEY=sk-proj-123 -d -p 3000:3000 -v $HOME/my-yt-data:/app/data christianfei/my-yt:latest
# or with docker in background, using Anthropic
docker run -e AI_MODEL=claude-xyz -e AI_HOST=https://api.anthropic.com -e AI_ENDPOINT=/v1/messages -e AI_APIKEY=your-key --rm -it -p 3000:3000 -v $HOME/my-yt-data:/app/data christianfei/my-yt:latest
```





## Skip transcoding to h264

If your system is under stress when downloading a video, that could be because of the automatic transcoding that's happening behind the scenes.

This is a feature to make the video compatible with most devices (especially iOS)

If you don't have the need, you can skip the transcoding process in the settings page.

Handles SSE for client updates

Implements HTTP Ranged requests for video playback

### [llm/index.js](https://github.com/christian-fei/my-yt/blob/main/lib/llm/index.js)

Makes requests using the chat completions API of your favorite LLM provider (either locally using LMStudio/Ollama, or hosted like OpenAI/Anthropic)

### [sse.js](https://github.com/christian-fei/my-yt/blob/main/lib/sse.js)

Utility functions for Server-sent events

### [subtitles-summary.js](https://github.com/christian-fei/my-yt/blob/main/lib/subtitles-summary.js)

### [youtube.js](https://github.com/christian-fei/my-yt/blob/main/lib/youtube.js)

yt-dlp wrapper to download videos, get channel videos and video information and transcript

### [repository.js](https://github.com/christian-fei/my-yt/blob/main/lib/repository.js)

Handles persistence of video information (set video as downloaded, summary, ignored, upserting videos, etc.)

### [client](https://github.com/christian-fei/my-yt/tree/main/client)

dependency less, bare HTML5, CSS3 and JS for a basic frontend

Handles SSE updates, interacting with the API






## Why?

- wanted to get back my chronological feed, instead of a "algorithmically curated" one
- no distractions
- no clickbait thumbnails (using `mq2` instead of `mqdefault` thumbnail, thanks @drcheap)
- no comments
- no related videos, or any algorithmically determined videos pushed in your face
- no sponsors, thanks to SponsorBlock
- just videos and a clean UI
- wanted to dabble with [Server-sent Events](https://github.com/christian-fei/my-yt/blob/main/lib/sse.js)
- wanted to try integrate the so much hyped AI in a personal project
- wanted to try out `yt-dlp`
- wanted to experiment with the HTML5 [`<track>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/track) element and [WebVTT API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebVTT_API)
- feedback was awesome on [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43373242), so here we are
- I am even paying for YouTube Premium, so it's not a matter of money, but a matter of control over my attention and enhanced offline experience
